In this assignment, I created a basic Node.js server using html , css and javascript. The server runs on a specific port and depending on the URL entered, it shows different HTML pages — for example, “/” shows the home page of the laundry website, “/about” shows the about page of laundry website, and “/contact” shows the contact page and "/services" shows the different services available on our website. If the user goes to a route that doesn’t exist, the server displays a “404 Page Not Found” message. This assignment helped me understand how routing works in Node.js.
